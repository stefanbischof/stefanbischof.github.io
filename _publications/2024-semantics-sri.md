abstract: |
  The Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) is an energy rating scheme targeted at buildings to evaluate their capacity to integrate and benefit from smart technologies for enhanced energy efficiency and overall performance. Existing tools for SRI assessment and rating do not provide a standard format for data exchange. However, there are several scenarios in which a FAIR, standardised data format is beneficial, such as data exchange between building tools, comparison of different assessments, or computing statistics about buildings.
