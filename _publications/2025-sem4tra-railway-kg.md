abstract: |
  In the last years railway infrastructure data has become available via public SPARQL endpoints. The ontologies/vocabularies used to represent the topology part of the railway  data are mainly based either on the Open Street Map (OSM) data model or on the UML-based RailTopoModel. In this paper we discuss some of the challenges of integrating railway infrastructure data especially topological data. As an example, we show how to link the data available for the Austrian railway network using Open Street Map data via the QLever SPARQL endpoint and data from the ERA Knowledge Graph.
