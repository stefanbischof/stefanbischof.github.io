abstract: |
  This paper describes our approach for leveraging LLMs to generate definitions and descriptions for ontology terms. Our approach is grounded in the need for detailed and accurate representation of (domain-specific) Knowledge Graphs, and it aims at speeding up the process of generating such text. We outline our approach, including the problems that we encountered, and the solution we propose to overcome them. Our approach is currently in use in an industrial setting.
